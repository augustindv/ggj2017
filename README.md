## Global Game Jam 2017 ##

The game was made in 48 hours in a team of 4 during the Global Game Jam 2017.
Cold Depths takes place during a future ice age, civilizations are collapsing and nations are fighting each other to save the remaining resources. You couldn't bare this situation anymore so you decided to run away from the army with your crew inside an old submarine.
You're heading south, hoping to find some place far from this madness which could be your new home. Will your crew make it ? It's up to you. Cold Depths is a solo survival & micro-management game where you play a 3-member crew in an old submarine. You'll need to be organized if you want to survive, the deep ocean is a dangerous place. Try to get as far as possible to beat your own score.
